# subhouse
Nurturing Substrate influential founders at one place funded from Polkadot/Kusama Treasury

### Inspiration
Inspired by [HackBase coming from CCC / Hackerspaces movement](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackbase) & [CreatorCabins](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins) 

We would like to set affordable living & cover food costs for those who are super willing contribute to Polkadot/Kusama/Substrate ecosystem and to take charge relocate to subHouse and be co-located at strong hive of substrate wisdom and hard working peers

### Running Costs

Running costs should be covered by operator, which can go and ask Treasury for reimbruss costs for doing this amazing service in legacy world and slowly forming small crypto hyper-local enclaves before entact [network unions](https://1729.com/network-union/)
